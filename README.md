# Bossfight
The Main branch of the project is master. If you are worried about making a bad commit, it is always safest to branch out.
This project is in prototype stage, treat version control as such.
Use the following procedure when going to work, and submit work on the prototype:
- Ensure no one else is making commits on the same files you are. If you are commiting on a level for a example, ensure before
starting work that you are the only one working on that level.
-Do your work, and report after you are fully sync'd up to maximize potential contribution.
-To create a commit, select the files relevant to the work performed. This will mean checking/UNCHECKING boxes! Until more 
effort is put into learning git, this will be a MUST do step. Do NOT commit an unwanted file and cause a sync error! This will
result most likely in a loss of work!
-Changes that are not in the commit should be discarded. This will help avoid syncing issues.
